# 📊 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict stock closing prices using historical data and technical indicators. It compares three machine learning models — Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor — to identify the best-performing approach.

## 🔍 Objective

The goal is to build a reliable and interpretable model that can accurately predict stock prices using real-world financial datasets. The process includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
  
## 🌟 Achievements

- ✅ Achieved **99% accuracy** (R² = 0.990) using **Linear Regression**
- ✅ Reduced RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to **1.92**, significantly improving prediction quality
- ✅ Outperformed Decision Tree and Random Forest regressors with minimal tuning
- ✅ Built a clean, modular workflow ready for future model scaling or deployment

## ⚙️ Models Compared

- **Linear Regression** – Highest accuracy and lowest error
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
